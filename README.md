# General-Mechanics-Simulation

Work in progress.. Was used to generate stress tests for the constraint solver to assist in system calibration.

Notes on some dependencies:
- SDL 2.0.12
- Unofficial OpenGL Math library
- Uses OpenGL 4+
  - OpenGL3+ is fine, just changes some declarations of version in SDL Init and shaders
